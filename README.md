# CPAP-Wallmount
 Wallmounted holder for CPAP tube and mask.

 This is away to store your CPAP tube hanging down to drip off excess water after rinsing.

 Use the inner ring to store the headband of your mask, the nosepiece in the center and the tube hung over the outer arch.

 As this design is too large for my printer, it is not only available as one single stl-file, but also split up in three parts that can be printed seperately and glued together.

 The back is fitted with two mounting holes that can fit one of the hook designs or mount the holder to any surface with a bit of double sided tape.
